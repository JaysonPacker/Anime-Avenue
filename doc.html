        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p> I started my work the Html then the JavaScript. The first problem I ran into was loading data on the initial startup. I ended up working on most of my JavaScript and some of my css before fixing the problem with help from the professor. Then I tried to add the feature of saving data but ended up having troubles of reuploading the saved genre. 
            so I stepped away from that and continued my css. While doing my CSS I realized there was a large variation in the results generated after working a few different solutions I decided to limit all results to tv shows only and added a few "if" statements in the code that builds my search results, so that info that I noticed coming up as null in a few different cases would just not display. I struggled a bit with the css for my results but more so coming up what it should look like rather than how to make it.  </p>
